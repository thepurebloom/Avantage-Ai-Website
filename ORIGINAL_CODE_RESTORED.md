# ‚úÖ Original Code Restored

## What Was Done

I've restored the **exact original code** you provided, with only minimal necessary changes for Next.js and TypeScript compatibility.

## Changes Made (Required for Next.js)

### 1. **Added "use client" Directive**
```tsx
"use client";
```
Required for Next.js App Router when using browser APIs, hooks, and Three.js.

### 2. **Updated Three.js Import Paths**
```tsx
// Changed from:
import { EffectComposer } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/EffectComposer';

// To:
import { EffectComposer } from 'three/addons/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js';
```
**Why:** Three.js 0.163+ moved examples from `/examples/jsm/` to `/addons/` path.

### 3. **Added TypeScript Types**
```tsx
// Added type annotations for refs
const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);
const threeRefs = useRef<any>({...});

// Added type annotations for function parameters
refs.stars.forEach((starField: any, i: number) => {...});
```

### 4. **File Extension**
- Changed from `.jsx` to `.tsx` for TypeScript

## What Was NOT Changed

‚úÖ **All original logic preserved**
- Exact same Three.js scene setup
- Same camera movements
- Same scroll handling
- Same mountain parallax behavior
- Same section structure (HORIZON, COSMOS, INFINITY)
- Same GSAP animations
- Same star field generation
- Same nebula shader
- Same atmosphere effects

‚úÖ **No performance optimizations added**
- No RAF throttling
- No will-change CSS properties
- No section fade transitions
- Original scroll event handling

‚úÖ **Original CSS preserved**
- All original styles intact
- No additional transitions
- No performance-related CSS changes

## How to Test

1. **Stop current dev server** (if running):
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where dev server is running
   ```

2. **Clear build cache**:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/meersheikh/Avantage Ai website"
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. **Start fresh**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open browser**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000
   - Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+F5` (Windows)

5. **Test scrolling**:
   - Scroll down slowly
   - Watch the camera move through space
   - See mountains parallax
   - Stars rotate gently

## Expected Behavior

This is the **exact original implementation** behavior:

### Section 0 (Top - 50% scroll)
- Title: "HORIZON" visible and fixed
- Camera: z = 300 (far view)
- Mountains: In foreground
- Nebula: Far in background

### Section 1 (50% - 100% scroll)
- Title: Still shows "HORIZON" (fixed content)
- Camera: Moves from z = 300 ‚Üí z = -50 ‚Üí z = -700
- Mountains: Parallax backward based on scroll
- Mountains disappear at 70% scroll progress
- Additional sections (COSMOS, INFINITY) visible as you scroll

### Scroll Sections
The component creates 2 additional scrollable sections:
- Section 1: COSMOS
- Section 2: INFINITY

These appear below the fixed hero content as you scroll.

## Known Original Behavior

Based on your original code:

1. **Hero title stays fixed** - The main "HORIZON" title at the top is `position: fixed` and stays in place
2. **Sections scroll below** - COSMOS and INFINITY sections scroll normally in the document flow
3. **Mountains disappear** - At 70% scroll, mountains move to z = 600000 (essentially invisible)
4. **Camera travels** - Smoothly moves through three predefined positions
5. **Direct scroll events** - No throttling, updates on every scroll event

## Files Status

‚úÖ **Restored Files:**
- `src/components/ui/horizon-hero-section.tsx` - ORIGINAL CODE
- `src/app/globals.css` - Original styles
- `tsconfig.json` - Strict mode enabled

‚ùå **Removed Files:**
- `src/app/error.tsx` - Removed
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` - Removed
- `src/app/global-error.tsx` - Removed
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Superseded by this document

## Summary

You now have your **exact original code** running in a Next.js environment. The only changes are:
1. `"use client"` directive (required)
2. Three.js import paths updated to `/addons/` (required for Three.js 0.163+)
3. TypeScript type annotations (required for `.tsx`)

Everything else is **100% your original implementation**! üéâ

## Need Help?

If you're experiencing:
- **Pixel breaks** - This is expected with direct scroll events (original behavior)
- **Fixed title** - This is expected (original `position: fixed` CSS)
- **Any build errors** - Run `npm run dev` and check console

The code is now exactly as you provided! üöÄ
